Project #1 required that we create a program that displays the generational progress of Wolfram's Rule-45 Cellular Automaton. We closely followed some online tutorials for creating the Cella rule 45 program. We decided to create an array that would go through each of the pixesl. We first initialized the array with all 0's and then changed top rows 200th cell to 1. We then created a generate() and rule() function inorder to go through the grid and check if each three cells (previous, current, next) match any of the rules. The last function is the display() function which goes through the array and adds the  corresponding color to the cell. We have a total of two javascript files (draw-stuff.js and ca.js), one css file (styles.css), and one html file (js-1.html).

For our project we downloaded and used a Javascript library called p5*Js for helping draw the grid.
Installation Process for p5*Js:
1. Copy and paste the link below to be redirected to the p5*Js download website.
	http://p5js.org/download/
2. When your able to access the website start click the p5.js complete library option to start downloading.
3. After you start the download process a zip file named "p5.zip" will appear. When it does you need to extract the whole folder.
4. After you have extracted the file you can then proceed to the running instructions below.

Running the Project file
1. We have submitted a zip file of our project and inorder to run it you want to first unzip the folder.
2. The folder contains a total of five files (draw-stuff.js, ca.js, styles.css, js-1.html, and README.txt).
3. Inorder for our project to correctly run all the files must be in the same folder.
4. And to run the project you can click the js-1 html file to be redirected to a browser. (For running our project we used 
   Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer.)

There appears to be no bugs in our project.
